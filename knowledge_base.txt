Vibrant Matter
A Political Ecology of Things

The Agency of Assemblages

Thing-power perhaps has the rhetorical advantage of calling to mind a
childhood sense of the world as filled with all sorts of animate beings,
some human, some not, some organic, some not. It draws attention to
an efficacy of objects in excess of the human meanings, designs, or pur-
poses they express or serve. Thing-power may thus be a good starting
point for thinking beyond the life-matter binary, the dominant organi-
zational principle of adult experience. The term's disadvantage, how-
ever, is that it also tends to overstate the thinginess or fixed stability of
materiality, whereas my goal is to theorize a materiality that is as much
force as entity, as much energy as matter, as much intensity as extension.
Here the term out-side may prove more apt. Spinoza’s stones, an abso-
lute Wild, the oozing Meadowlands, the nimble Odradek, the moving
deodand, a processual minerality, an incalculable nonidentity—none
of these are passive objects or stable entities (though neither are they
intentional subjects).' They allude instead to vibrant materials.
A second, related disadvantage of thing-power is its latent individual-
ism, by which I mean the way in which the figure of “thing” lends itself
to an atomistic rather than a congregational understanding of agency.

the agency of assemblages 21

While the smallest or simplest body or bit may indeed express a vital
impetus, conatus or clinamen, an actant never really acts alone. Its effi-
cacy or agency always depends on the collaboration, cooperation, or
interactive interference of many bodies and forces. A lot happens to
the concept of agency once nonhuman things are figured less as social
constructions and more as actors, and once humans themselves are as-
sessed not as autonoms but as vital materialities.

In this chapter I will try to develop a theory of distributive agency by
examining a real-life effect: a power blackout that affected 50 million
people in North America in 2003. I will offeran analysis of the electrical
power grid as an agentic assemblage. How does the agency of assem-
blages compare to more familiar theories of action, such as those cen-
tered around human will or intentionality, or around intersubjectivity,
or around (human) social, economic, or discursive structures? And how
would an understanding of agency as a confederation of human and
nonhuman elements alter established notions of moral responsibility
and political accountability?

Two philosophical concepts are important to my response to these
questions: Spinoza’s “affective” bodies and Gilles Deleuze and Félix
Guattari’s “assemblage.” I will therefore offer a brief exposition of these
concepts before I turn to an account of the power blackout that tries to
take the out-side seriously and tries to remain faithful to the distributive
quality of “agency.”

Affective Bodies ss

Spinoza's conative bodies are also associative or (one could even say)
social bodies, in the sense that each is, by its very nature as a body,
continuously affecting and being affected by other bodies. Deleuze ex-
plicates this point: the power of a body to affect other bodies includes a
“corresponding and inseparable” capacity to be affected; “there are two
equally actual powers, that of acting, and that of suffering action, which
vary inversely one to the other, but whose sum is both constant and
constantly effective.”? Spinoza’s conative, encounter-prone body arises
in the context of an ontological vision according to which all things are

- “modes” of a common “substance”? Any specific thing —“a shoe, a ship,

a cabbage, a king” (to use Martin Lin’s list)* or a glove, a rat, a cap, and


22 chapter 2

the human narrator of their vitality (to use my list)—is neither subject
nor object but a “mode” of what Spinoza calls “Deus sive Natura” (God
or Nature)

Spinoza also says that every mode is itself a mosaic or assemblage of
many simple bodies, or, as Deleuze describes it, there are for Spinoza no
“existing modes that are not actually composed of a very great number
of extensive parts,” parts that “come to it from elsewhere.”® It is inter-
esting that Lucretius, too, saw mosaicism as the way things essentially
are: “It is right to have this truth . . . surely sealed and to keep it stored
in your remembering mind, that there is not one of all the things, whose
nature is seen before our face, which is built of one kind of primordia,
nor anything which is not created of well-mingled seed.” Lucretius links
the degree of internal diversity to the degree of power possessed by the
thing: “And whatever possesses within it more forces and powers, it thus

shows that there are in it most kinds of primordia and diverse shapes.”
Spinoza, as we shall see, makes a similar point.

For Spinoza, both simple bodies (which are perhaps better termed
protobodies) and the complex or mosaicized modes they form are cona-
tive. In the case of the former, conatus is expressed as a stubbornness
or inertial tendency to persist; in the case of a complex body or mode,
conatus refers to the effort required to maintain the specific relation of
“movement and rest” that obtains between its parts, a relation that de-
fines the mode as what it is. This maintenance is not a process of mere
repetition of the same, for it entails continual invention: because each
mode suffers the actions on it by other modes, actions that disrupt the
relation of movement and rest characterizing each mode, every mode,
if it is to persist, must seek new encounters to creatively compensate
for the alterations or affections it suffers. What it means to be a “mode,”
then, is to form alliances and enter assemblages: it is to mod(e)ify and
be modified by others. The process of modification is not under the con-

trol of any one mode—no mode is an agent in.the hierarchical sense.

Neither is the process without tension, for each mode vies with and

against the (changing) affections of (a changing set of) other modes, all

the while being subject to the element of chance or contingency intrin-
sic to any encounter.’

Conative substance turns itself into confederate bodies, that is, com-
plex bodies that in turn congregate with each other in the pursuit of
the enhancement of their power. Spinoza believes, for example, that the

the agency of assemblages 23

more kinds of bodies with which a body can affiliate, the better: “As the
body is more capable of being affected in many ways and of affecting
external bodies . . . so the mind is more capable of thinking”

The key idea I want to take from Spinoza’s rich and contestable phi-
losophy, an idea I will put to work for a vital materialism, is this: bodies
enhance their power in or as a heterogeneous assemblage. What this sug-
gests for the concept of agency is that the efficacy or effectivity to which
that term has traditionally referred becomes distributed across an onto-
logically heterogeneous field, rather than being a capacity localized.in
a human body or in a collective produced (only) by human efforts. The
sentences of this book also emerged from the confederate agency of
many striving macro- and microactants: from “my” memories, inten-
tions, contentions, intestinal bacteria, eyeglasses, and blood sugar, as
well as from the plastic computer keyboard, the bird song from the open
window, or the air or particulates in the room, to name only a few of the
participants. What is at work here on the page is an animal-vegetable-
mineral-sonority cluster with a particular degree and duration of power.
What is at work here is what Deleuze and Guattari call an assemblage.

What Is an Assemblage?

At the end of the twentieth century, the arena in which stuff happens —
What the military calls the “theater of operations” seemed to many
. people to have expanded dramatically. “Globalization” had occurred and
the earth itself had become a space of events. ‘The parts of this giant
_ whole were both intimately interconnected and highly conflictual. This
fact— of the coexistence of mutual dependency with friction and vio-
lence between parts—called for new conceptualizations of the part-
whole relation. Organicist models, in which each member obediently
serves the whole, were clearly out. A host of new ways to name the kind
of relation obtaining between the parts of a volatile but somehow func-
tioning whole were offered: network, meshwork, Empire." My term of
‘choice to describe this event-space and its style of structuration is, fol-
-lowing Deleuze and Guattari, assemblage.
Assemblages are ad hoc groupings of diverse elements, of vibrant
materials of all sorts. Assemblages are living, throbbing confederations
that are able to function despite the persistent presence of energies that


24, chapter 2

confound them from within. They have uneven topographies, because
some of the points at which the various affects and bodies cross paths
are more heavily trafficked than others, and so power is not distributed
equally across its surface. Assemblages are not governed by any central
head: no one materiality or type of material has sufficient competence
to determine consistently the trajectory or impact of the group. The
effects generated by an assemblage are, rather, emergent properties,
emergent in that their ability to make something happen (a newly in-
flected materialism, a blackout, a hurricane, a war on terror) is distinct
from the sum of the vital force of each materiality considered alone.
Each member and proto-member of the assemblage has a certain vital
force, but there is also an effectivity proper to the grouping as such: an
agency of the assemblage. And precisely because each member-actant
maintains an energetic pulse slightly “off” from that of the assemblage,
an assemblage is never a stolid block but an open-ended collective, a
“non-totalizable sum.’* An assemblage thus not only has a distinctive
history of formation but a finite life span.

The electrical power grid offers a good example of an assemblage. It is
a material cluster of charged parts that have indeed affiliated, remaining
in sufficient proximity and coordination to produce distinctive effects.
The elements of the assemblage work together, although their coordina-
tion does not rise to the level of an organism. Rather, its jelling endures
alongside energies and factions that fly out from it and disturb it from
within. And, most important for my purposes, the elements of this as-
semblage, while they include humans and their (social, legal, linguistic)
constructions, also include some very active and powerful nonhumans:
electrons, trees, wind, fire, electromagnetic fields.

The image of affective bodies forming assemblages will enable me to
highlight some of the limitations in human-centered theories of action
and to investigate some of the practical implications, for social-science
inquiry and for public culture, of a theory of action and responsibility
that crosses the human-nonhuman divide.

The Blackout

The International Herald Tribune, on the day after the blackout, reported
that “the vast but shadowy web of transmission lines, power generat-

the agency of assemblages 25

ing plants and substations known as the grid is the biggest gizmo ever
built. . . . on Thursday [14 August 2003], the grid’s heart fluttered. . . .
complicated beyond full understanding, even by experts—[the grid]
lives and occasionally dies by its own mysterious rules.’ To say that
- the grid’s “heart fluttered” or that it “lives and dies by its own rules” is
to anthropomorphize. But anthropomorphizing has, as I shall argue in
- chapter 8, its virtues. Here it works to gesture toward the inadequacy of
understanding the grid simply as a machine ora tool, as, that is, a series
of fixed parts organized from without that serves an external purpose.
To the vital materialist, the electrical grid is better understood as a
volatile mix of coal, sweat, electromagnetic fields, computer programs,
electron streams, profit motives, heat, lifestyles, nuclear fuel, plastic,
fantasies of mastery, static, legislation, water, economic theory, wire,
and wood—to name just some of the actants. There is always some fric-
tion among the parts, but for several days in August 2003 in the United
States and Canada the dissonance was so great that cooperation became
impossible. The North American blackout was the end point of a cas-
cade— of voltage collapses, self-protective withdrawals from the grid,
and human decisions and omissions. The grid includes various valves
and circuit breakers that disconnect parts from the assemblage when-
ever they are threatened by excessive heat. Generating plants, for ex-
ample, shut down just before they are about to go into “full excitation,”
_and they do the same when the “system voltage has become too low to
provide power to the generator’s own auxiliary equipment, such as fans,
coal pulverizers, and pumps.”** What seems to have happened on that
August day was that several initially unrelated generator withdrawals
~ in Ohio and Michigan caused the electron flow pattem to change over
the transmission lines, which led, after a series of events including one
brush fire that burnt a transmission line and then several wire-tree en-
counters, to a successive overloading of other lines and a vortex of dis-
connects. One generating plant after another separated from the grid,
placing more and more stress on the remaining participants. In a one-
minute period, “twenty generators (loaded to 2174 mw) tripped off line
“along Lake Erie””
Investigators still do not understand why the cascade ever stopped
itself, after affecting 50 million people over approximately twenty-four
_ thousand square kilometers and shutting down over one hundred power
: ants, including twenty-two nuclear reactors.” The U.S.-Canada Power


+26 chapter 2

Outage Task Force report was more confident about how the cascade
began, insisting on a variety of agential loci.® These included electricity,
with its internal differentiation into “active” and “reactive” power (more
on this later); the. power plants, understaffed by humans but overpro-
tective in their mechanisms; transmission wires, which tolerate only so
much heat before they refuse to transmit the electron flow; a brush fire
in Ohio; Enron FirstEnergy and other energy-trading corporations, who,
by legal and illegal means, had been milking the grid without main-
taining its infrastructure; consumers, whose demand for electricity
grows and is encouraged to grow by the government without concern
for consequences; and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whose
Energy Policy Act of 1992 deregulated the grid, separated the genera-
tion of electricity from its transmission and distribution, and advanced
the privatization of electricity. Let me say a bit more about the first and
the last of these conative bodies in the assemblage.

First, the nonhuman: electricity. Electricity is a stream of electrons
moving in a current, which is measured in amperes; the force of that
current (the pressure pushing it through the wires) is measured in volts.
Ina system like the North American grid, electrical current and voltage
are constantly oscillating like a pair of waves.” When the two waves are
in phase with each other (rising and falling at exactly the same time),
one has so-called active power, or the type of power used most heavily
by lamps, blow-dryers, and other appliances. But some devices (such
as the electric motors in refrigerators and air conditioners) rely also
on so-called reactive power, where the waves are not in sync. Reactive
power, though it lends no help in physically rotating a motor, is vital
to the active power that accompanies it, for reactive power maintains
the voltage (electricity pressure) needed to sustain the electromagnetic
field required by the system as a whole. If too many devices demand re-
active power, then a deficit is created. One of the causes of the blackout
was a deficit of reactive power. To understand how the deficit occurred,
we need to consider the other actants, including the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission.

In 1992 the commission gained U.S. congressional approval for legis-
lation that sepaxated the production of electricity from its distribution:
companies could now buy electricity from a power plant in one part of
the country and sell it to utilities in geographically distant locations.

the agency of assemblages 27

This greatly increased the long-distance trading of electric power—and
greatly increased the load on transmission wires. But here is the rub: “As
transmission lines become more heavily loaded, they consume more of
the reactive power needed to maintain proper transmission voltage.”**
Reactive power does not travel well, dissipating over distance, so it is
-best if generated close to where it will be used.” Power plants are tech-
nically quite capable of producing extra amounts of reactive power, but
they lack the financial incentive to do so, for reactive-power production
_ reduces the amount of salable power produced. What is more, under
_ the new regulations, transmission companies cannot compel generating
plants to produce the necessary amounts of reactive power

Reactive power, vital to the whole grid, proved a commodity with-
“out profit and thus came in short supply. Here emerged what Garrett
~ Hardin has called a tragedy of the commons. Though rational for each
“user of reactive power to increase its demand for the free commodity,
the aggregate effect is irrational in that it destroys the wellspring: in a
world of finite resources, “freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.”
- The reactive power deficit was an effect unanticipated by human advo-
cates of the regulations that created a huge, continent-wide market in
energy trading. Their actions produced unintended consequences; or, to
put the point in a vital materialist vocabulary, they were subject to the
“slight surprise of action.” The phrase is Bruno Latour’s, and it refers to

an effectivity proper to the action itself, arising only in the doing and
thus in principle independent of any aim, tendency, or characteristic of
the actants: “There is no object, no subject. . . . But there are events. I

ever act; I am always slightly surprised by what I do.’

-Neither, says Latour, is the slight surprise of action confined to.
human action: “That which acts through me is also surprised by what I

do, by the chance to mutate, to change, . . . to bifurcate.””* In the case

at hand, electricity was also an actant, and its strivings also produced.

aleatory effects. For example, “in the case of a power shipment from the

Pacific Northwest to Utah, 33% of the shipment flows through Southern

California and 30% flows through Arizona—far from any conceivable

contract path.’?7 And in August of 2003, after “the transmission lines

along the southern shore of Lake Erie disconnected, the power that had

been flowing along that path” dramatically and surprisingly changed its

behavior: it “immediately reversed direction and began flowing in a giant


i

loop counterclockwise from Pennsylvania to New York to Ontario and
into Michigan.”* Seeking to minimize the company’s role in the black-
out, aspokesman for FirstEnergy, the Ohio-based company whose East-
lake power plant was an early actant in the cascade and an early target
of blame, said that any analysis needed to “take into account large un-
planned south-to-north power movements that were part ofa phenome-
non known as loop flows, which occur when power takes a route from
producer to buyer different from the intended path.” Electricity, or
the stream of vital materialities called electrons, is always on the move,
always going somewhere, though where this will be is not entirely pre-
dictable. Electricity sometimes goes where we send it, and sometimes it
chooses its path on the spot, in response to the other bodies it encoun-
ters and the surprising opportunities for actions and interactions that
hey afford.

Jn this selective account of the blackout, agency, conceived now
as something distributed along a continuum, extrudes from multiple
sites or many loci—from a quirky electron flow and a spontaneous fire
to members of Congress who have a neoliberal faith in market self-
regulation. How does this view compare to other conceptions of what
an agent is and can do?

c.

The Willing Subject and the Intersubjective Field

T have been suggesting that there is not so much a doer (an agent) be-
bind the deed (the blackout) as a doing and an effecting by a human-
nonhuman assemblage. This federation of actants is a creature that the
concept of moral responsibility fits only loosely and to which the charge
of blame will not quite stick. A certain looseness and slipperiness, often
unnoticed, also characterizes more human-centered notions of agency.
Augustine, for example, linked moral agency to free will, but the human
willis, as Augustine reveals in his Confessions, divided against itself after
the Fall: the will wills even as another part of the will fights that willing.
Moreover, willing agents can act freely only in support of evil: never are
they able by themselves to enact the good, for that always requires the
intervention of divine grace, a force beyond human control. Agency,
then, is not such a clear idea or a self-sufficient power in Augustine?

the agency of assemblages 29

Neither is it in Immanuel Kant. He aspired to define agency in terms
of the autonomous will of the person who submits to the moral law
(whose form is inscribed in human reason). But, as William Connolly
has explored, Kant, too, eventually found the will to be divided against
itself, this time by an innate “propensity” for evil, wherein the will obeys
maxims that derive from the inclinations." It is not merely that the will

" fights against the pressure of an unwilled “sensibility”: the propensity
for evil lives inside the will itself. Human agency again appears as a
vexed concept, though its snarls and dilemmas are easy to skate over
when the alternatives are reduced to either a free human agency or pas-
sive, deterministic matter.

Some neo-Kantian accounts of agency emphasize intentionality (the
power to formulate and enact aims) more than the moral will, but here
the question is whether other forces in the world approximate some
of the characteristics of intentional or purposive behavior on the part
of humans.” An acknowledgment of something like this, of a kind of
thing-power, may be at work in the “agency-versus-structure” debate
in the social sciences, according to which structures are described as
powerful entities that work with and against human purposes. But the
_ category of “structure” is ultimately unable to give the force of things
its due: a structure can act only negatively, as a constraint on human
agency, or passively, as an enabling background or context for it. Active
action or agency belongs to humans alone: “All agree that agency refers
to the intentional choices made by men and women as they take action
» to realize their goals,” even though “these actors are socially constituted
= beings embedded in sociocultural and ecological surroundings that
both define their goals and constrain their actions.”** Actors are “so-
cially constituted,” but the “constitutive” or productive power of struc-
tures derives from the human wills or intentions within them. There is
no agency proper to assemblages, only the effervescence of the agency
~ of individuals acting alone or in concert with each other. Structures,
surroundings, and contexts make a difference to outcomes, but they are
not quite vibrant matter.

The same point applies, I think, to the phenomenological theory of
agency set forth by Maurice Merleau-Ponty. His Phenomenology of Per-
_-ception was designed to avoid placing too much weight on human will,
intentionality, or reason. It focused instead on the embodied charac-


30 chapter 2 the agency of assemblages 31

ter of human action, through its concept of motor intentionality>+ and |-
on the agentic contributions made by an intersubjective field25 Diana
Coole, taking up Merleau-Ponty’s task, replaces the discrete agent and
its “residual individualism” with a “spectrum” of “agentic capacities”
housed sometimes in individual persons, sometimes in human physio

‘human ingenuity,” or “a simple white screen to support the differentia-
ion of society.”3*

‘The vital materialist must admit that different materialities, com-
posed of different sets of protobodies, will express different powers.
{umans, for example, can experience themselves as forming intentions
and as standing apart from their actions to reflect on the latter. But even
here it may be relevant to note the extent to which intentional reflex-
Avity is also a product of the interplay of human and nonhuman forces.
Jernard Stiegler does just this in his study of how tool-use engendered
being with an inside, with, that is, a psychological landscape of in-
teriority. Stiegler contends that conscious reflection in (proto)humans
first emerged with the use of stone tools because the materiality of the
tool acted as an external marker of a past need, as an “archive” of its
function. The stone tool (its texture, color, weight), in calling attention
its projected and recollected use, produced the first hollow of reflec-
ion.” Humanity and nonhumanity have always performed an intricate
dance with each other. There was never a time when human agency was
anything other than an interfolding network of humanity and nonhu-
manity; today this mingling has become harder to ignore.

logical processes or motor intentionality, and sometimes in human so-
cial structures or the “interworld”: “At one pole [of the spectrum of.
agentic capacities] I envisage pre-personal, non-cognitive bodily pro-
cesses; at the other, transpersonal, intersubjective processes that in-
stantiate an interworld. Between them are singularities: phenomena
with a relatively individual or collective identity.”

Coole’s attempt to dislodge agency from its exclusive mooring in the
individual, rational subject provides an important touchstone for my at-
tempt to extend the spectrum even further— beyond human bodies and
intersubjective fields to vital materialities and the human-nonhuman
assemblages they form. For though Coole’s spectrum gives no special _
privilege to the human individual, it recognizes only human powers:
human biological and neurological processes, human personalities,
human social practices and institutions. Coole limits the spectrum
in this way because she is interested in a specifically political kind of
agency, and for her politics is an exclusively human affair. Here I dis-
agree, and as I will argue in chapter 7, a case can be made for including .
nonhumans in the demos. The prevention of future blackouts, for ex-
ample, will depend on a host of cooperative efforts: Congress will have
to summon the courage to fight industry demands at odds with a more
common good, but reactive power will also have to do its part, on con-
dition that it is not asked to travel too far. A vital materialism attempts a ~
more radical displacement of the human subject than phenomenology -
has done, though Merleau-Ponty himself seemed to be moving in this
direction in his unfinished Visible and Unvisible.

That text begins to undo the conceit that humanity is the sole or ulti- _
mate wellspring of agency. So does Latour’s Aramis, which shows how |
the cars, electricity, and magnets of an experimental Parisian mass tran-
sit system acted positively (and not just as a constraint) alongside the
activities of human and intersubjective bodies, words, and regulations”
Latour’s later work continues to call for people to imagine other roles
for things besides that of carriers of necessity, or “plastic” vehicles for

- Efficacy, Trajectory, Causality

Theodor Adomo claimed that it was not possible to “unseal” or parse
concept into its constituent parts: one could only “circle” around a
mcept, perhaps until one gets dizzy or arrives at the point at which
nidentity with the real can no longer be ignored. What also happens
one circles around a concept is that a set of related terms comes

among others) efficacy, trajectory, and causality.

Efficacy points to the creativity of agency, to a capacity to make
mething new appear or occur. In the tradition that defines agency
as moral capacity, such new effects are understood as having arisen in
e wake of an advance plan or an intention, for agency “involves not
mere motion, but willed or intended motion, where motion can only
be willed or intended by a subject.”* A theory of distributive agency, in
contrast, does not posit a subject as the root cause of an effect. There

ito view, as a swarm of affiliates. In the case of agency, these include


32 chapter 2

are instead always a swarm of vitalities at play. The task becomes to
identify the contours of the swarm and the kind of relations that obtain
between its bits. To figure the generative source of effects as a swarm
is to see human intentions as always in competition and confederation
with many other strivings, for an intention is like a pebble thrown into
a pond, or an electrical current sent through a wire or neural network:
it vibrates and merges with other currents, to affect and be affected.
This understanding of agency does not deny the existence of that thrust
called intentionality, but it does see it as less definitive of outcomes. It
loosens the connections between efficacy and the moral subject, bring-
ing efficacy closer to the idea of the power to make a difference that calls
for response. And this power, I contend along with Spinoza and others,
is a power possessed by nonhuman bodies too.

In addition to being tied to the idea of efficacy, agency is also bound
up with the idea of a trajectory, a directionality or movement away

from somewhere even if the toward-which it moves is obscure or even
absent. Moral philosophy has figured this trajection as a purposiveness
or a goal-directedness linked to a (human or divine) mind capable of
choice and intention, but Jacques Derrida offers an alternative to this
consciousness-centered thinking by figuring trajectory as “messianicity.”
Messianicity is the open-ended promissory quality of a claim, image, or
entity. This unspecified promise is for Derrida the very condition of pos-
sibility of phenomenality: things in the world appear to us at all only
because they tantalize and hold us in suspense, alluding to a fullness
that is elsewhere, to a future that, apparently, is on its way. For Derrida
this promissory note is never and can never be redeemed: the “straining
forward toward the event” never finds relief. To be alive is to be waiting
“for someone or something that, in order to happen . . . must exceed and
surprise every determinate anticipation.” In naming the unfulfillable
promise as the condition of the appearance of anything, Derrida pro-
vides a way for the vital materialist to affirm the existence of a certain
trajectory or drive to assemblages without insinuating intentionality or
purposiveness.

A third element in the agentic swarm is perhaps the most vague of
all: causality. If agency is distributive or confederate, then instances of
efficient causality, with its chain of simple bodies acting as the sole im-
petus for the next effect, will be impossibly rare. Is George W. Bush the
efficient cause of the American invasion of Iraq? Is Osama bin Laden?

the agency of assemblages 33

If one extends the time frame of the action beyond that of even an in-
- stant, billiard-ball causality falters. Alongside and inside singular human
agents there exists a heterogenous series of actants with partial, over-
lapping, and conflicting degrees of power and effectivity.

Here causality is more emergent than efficient, more fractal than lin-
ear. Instead of an effect obedient to a determinant, one finds circuits in
which effect and cause alternate position and redound on each other.
If efficient causality seeks to rank the actants involved, treating some
as external causes and others as dependent effects, emergent causality
places the focus on the process as itself an actant, as itself in possession
of degrees of agentic capacity. According to Connolly,

: emergent causality is causal . . . in that a movement at [one] .. . level has
effects at another level. But it is emergent in that, first, the character of
the . . . activity is not knowable in. . . detail prior to effects that emerge at
the second level. [Moreover,] . . . the new effects become infused into the
very. . . organization of the second level . .. such . . . that the cause cannot
be said to be fully different from the effect engendered. ... [Third,]...a
series of . . . feedback loops operate between first and second levels to gen-
erate the stabilized result. The new emergent is shaped not only by external
forces that become infused into it but also by its own previously under-tapped
capacities for reception and self-organization.

This sense of a melting of cause and effect is also expressed in the ordi-
- Dary usage of the term agent, which can refer both to a human subject
who is the sole and original author of an effect (as in “moral agent”) and
also to someone or something that is the mere vehicle or passive conduit
* for the will of another (as in “literary agent” or “insurance agent”).

If ordinary language intuits the existence of a nonlinear, novhierar-
 chical, non-subject-centered mode of agency, Hannah’ Arendt makes
the point explicitly by distinguishing between “cause” and “origin”
in her discussion of totalitarianism. A cause is a singular, stable, and
masterful initiator of effects, while an origin is a complex, mobile, and
‘heteronomous enjoiner of forces: “The elements of totalitarianism form
its origins if by origins we do not understand ‘causes: Causality, ie.,
the factor of determination of a process of events in which always one
~ event causes and can be explained by another, is probably an altogether
“alien and falsifying category in the realm of the historical and political
sciences. Elements by themselves probably never cause anything. They


34 chapter 2

become origins of events if and when they crystallize into fixed and
definite forms. Then, and only then, can we trace their history back-
wards. The event illuminates its own past, but it can never be deduced
from it.”#

For Arendt, it is impossible to discern in advance the cause of totali-
tarianism. Instead, like all political phenomena, its sources can only be
revealed retroactively. These sources are necessarily multiple, made up
of elements unaffiliated before the “crystallization” process began. In
fact, what makes the event happen is precisely the contingent coming
together of a set of elements. Here Arendt’s view is consonant with a dis-
tributive notion of agency. But if we look at what spurs such crystalliza-
tions for her, we see her revert to a more traditional, subject-centered
notion. Whereas the theorist of distributive agency would answer that
anything could touch off the crystallization process (a sound, a last
straw, a shoe, a blackout, a human intention), Arendt concludes that
while the “significance” of an event can exceed “the intentions which
eventually cause the crystallization, intentions are nevertheless the key
to the event. Once again, human intentionality is positioned as the most
important of all agential factors, the bearer of an exceptional kind of
power.®

Shi

Why speak of the agency of assemblages, and not, more modestly, of
their capacity to form a “culture,” or to “self-organize,” or to “partici-
pate” in effects? Because the rubric of material agency is likely to be a
stronger counter to human exceptionalism, to, that is, the human ten-
dency to understate the degree to which people, animals, artifacts, tech-
nologies, and elemental forces share powers and operate in dissonant
conjunction with each other. No one really knows what human agency
is, or what humans are doing when they are said to perform as agents. In
the face of every analysis, human agency remains something of a mys-
tery. If we do not know just how it is that human agency operates, how
can we be so sure that the processes through which nonhumans make
their mark are qualitatively different?

An assemblage owes its agentic capacity to the vitality of the mate-
‘ialities that constitute it. Something like this congregational agency

is called shi in the Chinese tradition. Shi helps to “illuminate some-
thing that is usually difficult to capture in discourse: namely, the kind
of potential that originates not in human initiative but instead results
from the very disposition of things.“ Shi is the style, energy, propensity,
trajectory, or élan inherent to a specific arrangement of things. Origi-
nally a word used in military strategy, shi emerged in the description ofa
good general who must be able to read and then ride the shi ofa configu-
ration of moods, winds, historical trends, and armaments: shi names the
dynamic force emanating from a spatio-temporal configuration rather
than from any particular element within it.

Again, the shi of an assemblage is vibratory; it is the mood or style
of an open whole in which both the membership changes over time
and the members themselves undergo internal alteration. Each mem-
ber “possesses autonomous emergent properties which are thus capable
of independent variation and therefore of being out of phase with one
another in time”*” When a member-actant, in the midst of a process
of self-alteration, becomes out of sync with its (previous) self, when,
if you like, it is in a reactive-power state,** it can form new sets of re-
lations in the assemblage and be drawn toward a different set of allies.
The members of an open whole never melt into a collective body, but
instead maintain an energy potentially at odds with the shi. Deleuze
invented the notion of “adsorbsion” to describe this kind of part-whole
relationship: adsorbsion is a gathering of elements in a way that both
forms. coalition and yet preserves something of the agential impetus of
each element.** It is because of the creative activity within actants that
the agency of assemblages is not best described in terms of social struc-
tures, a locution that designates a stolid whole whose efficacy resides
only in its conditioning recalcitrance or capacity to obstruct.

The shi of a milieu can be obvious or subtle. It can operate at the very

' threshold of human perception or more violently. A coffee house or a

school house is a mobile configuration of people, insects, odors, ink,
electrical flows, air currents, caffeine, tables, chairs, fluids, and sounds.
Their shi might at one time consist in the mild and ephemeral effluence
of good vibes, and at another in a more dramatic force capable of en-
gendering a philosophical or political movement, as it did in the cafés
of Jean-Paul Sartre’s and Simone de Beauvoir'’s Paris and in the Islamist
schools in Pakistan in the late twentieth century.

the order of material nature. To affirm a vitality distributed along a con-
tinuum of ontological types and to identify the human-nonhuman as-
semblage as a locus of agency is to unsettle this belief. But must a dis-
ibutive, composite notion of agency thereby abandon the attempt to
old individuals responsible for their actions or hold officials account-
le to the public? The directors of the FirstEnergy corporation were
all too eager to reach this conclusion in the task force report: no one
‘teally is to blame. Though it is unlikely that the energy traders shared
amy vital materialism, I, too, find it hard to assign the strongest or most
unitive version of moral responsibility to them. Autonomy and strong
responsibility seem to me to be empirically false, and thus their invoca-
ion seems tinged with injustice. In emphasizing the ensemble nature of
action and the interconnections between persons and things, a theory
f vibrant matter presents individuals as simply incapable of bearing full
onsibility for their effects.
e notion of a confederate agency does attenuate the blame game,
but it does not thereby abandon the project of identifying (what Arendt
called) the sources of harmful effects. To the contrary, such a notion
broadens the range of places to look for sources. Look to long-term

Political Responsibility and the Agency of Assemblages

The electrical grid, by blacking out, lit up quite a lot: the shabby con-
dition of the public-utilities infrastructure, the law-abidingness of New
York City residents living in the dark, the disproportionate and accel-
erating consumption of energy by North Americans, and the element

resonating elements. Thus spoke the grid. One might even say that it
exhibited a communicative interest. It will be objected that such com-
munication is possible only through the intermediary of humans. But is
this really an objection, given that even linguistic communication nec-
essarily entails intermediaries? My speech, for example, depends on the
graphite in my pencil, millions of persons, dead and alive, in my Indo-
European language group, not to mention the electricity in my brain
and my laptop. (The human brain, properly wired, can light up a fifteen-
watt bulb.) Humans and nonhumans alike depend on a “fabulously com-
plex” set of speech prostheses.°°
Noortje Marres rightly notes that “it is often hard to grasp just what
the sources of agency are that make a particular event happen” and that
this “ungraspability may be an [essential] aspect of agency.” But it is a
safe bet to begin with the presumption that the locus of political respon-
sibility is a human-nonhuman assemblage. On close-enough inspection,
the productive power that has engendered an effect will turn out to bea
confederacy, and the human actants within it will themselves turn out
to be confederations of tools, microbes, minerals, sounds, and other
“foreign” materialities. Human intentionality can emerge as agentic
only by way of such a distribution. The agency of assemblages is not the
strong, autonomous kind of agency to which Augustine and Kant (or an
omnipotent God) aspired; this is because the relationship between ten-
dencies and outcomes or between trajectories and effects is imagined

strings of events: to selfish intentions, to energy policy offering lucra-
tive opportunities for energy trading while generating a tragedy of the
‘ mmons, and to a psychic resistance to acknowledging a link between
American energy use, American imperialism, and anti-Americanism;
ut look also to the stubborn directionality of a high-consumption so-
infrastructure, to unstable electron flows, to conative wildfires, to
exurban housing pressures, and to the assemblages they form. In each
on the list, humans and their intentions participate, but they are
the sole or always the most profound actant in the assemblage.
ough it would give me pleasure to assert that deregulation and
orate greed are the real culprits in the blackout, the most I can
estly affirm is that corporations are one of the sites at which human
at reform can be applied, that corporate regulation is one place
re intentions might initiate a cascade of effects. Perhaps the ethical
onsibility of an individual human now resides in one’s response to
assemblages in which one finds oneself participating: Do I attempt

? Do I enter into the proximity of assemblages whose conglom-

as more porous, tenuous, and thus indirect.

Coole’s account of a spectrum of agentic capacities, like the kind of
agency that is subjected to structural constraints, does not recognize
the agency of human-nonhuman assemblages. And this is in part be-
cause of the difficulty of theorizing agency apart from the belief that
bumans are special in the sense of existing, at least in part, outside of


erate effectivity tends toward the enactment of nobler ends? Agency
is, I believe, distributed across a mosaic, but it is also possible to say
something about the kind of striving that may be exercised by a human
within the assemblage. This exertion is perhaps best understood on the
model of riding a bicycle on a gravel road. One can throw one’s weight
this way or that, inflect the bike in one direction or toward one trajec.
tory of motion. But the rider is but one actant operative in the moving
whole.

Tn a world of distributed agency, a hesitant attitude toward assigning
singular blame becomes a presumptive virtue. Of course, sometimes
moral outrage, akin to what Plato called thumos, is indispensable to
democratic;and just politics. In the years leading up to the publicatio
of this book, these were some of the things that called me to outrage:
the doctrine of preemptive war, the violation of human rights and of the
Geneva Accords at Guanténamo Bay, the torture of prisoners in Iraq and
in accordance with a policy of so-called extraordinary rendition, the re-
striction of protesters at President Bush’s public appearances to a “free
speech zone” out of the view of television cameras, the U.S. military’
policy of not keeping a count of Iraqi civilian deaths. Outrage will not
and should not disappear, but a politics devoted too exclusively to moral
condemnation and not enough to a cultivated discernment of the web
of agentic capacities can do little good. A moralized politics of good
and evil, of singular agents who must be made to pay for their sins (be
they bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, or Bush) becomes unethical to th
degree that it legitimates vengeance and elevates violence to the tool of
first resort. An understanding of agency as distributive and confederate
thus reinvokes the need to detach ethics from moralism and to produce
guides to action appropriate to a world of vital, crosscutting forces.

These claims are contestable, and other actants, enmeshed in other
assemblages, will offer different diagnoses of the political and its prob-
lems. It is ultimately a matter of political judgment what is more needed
today: should we acknowledge the distributive quality of agency to ad-
dress the power of human-nonhuman assemblages and to resist a poli
tics of blame? Or should we persist with a strategic understatement o}

material agency in the hopes of enhancing the accountability of specifi
humans?

dible Matter

is not controversial to say that trash, gadgets, electricity, and fire are
levant to politics, or to say that though such things do not qualify as
litical stakeholders, they form the milieu of human action or serve
“means or impediments to it. But do the categories of context, tool,
and constraint capture the full range of powers possessed by nonhuman.
bodies? In this chapter I will focus on one subset of those bodies, the
id that you can eat. I will treat food as conative bodies vying along-
le and within an other complex body (a person’s “own” body). To the
les of context, tool, and constraint (or background, resource, and
limit) I will add the role of actant. Food will appear as actant inside and
longside intention-forming, morality-(dis)obeying, language-using,
lexivity-wielding, and culture-making human beings, and as an
inducer-producer of salient, public effects. We can call the assemblage
med by these human and nonhuman bodies “American consump-
tion” and name as one of its effects the “crisis of obesity.”

My case for food as a participant in this assemblage has two prongs.
